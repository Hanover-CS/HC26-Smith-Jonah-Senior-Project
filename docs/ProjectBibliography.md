# Annotated Bibliography

## 1. Facebook Marketplace

**Link:** [https://www.facebook.com/marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site that is officially licensed and run by Facebook/Meta  

**Relation to App:**  
This app is similar to my end goal and is a leader in the private-used-E commerce platforms  

**Summary:**  
Facebook Marketplace is a platform that allows private buyers and sellers to engage in a local used marketplace. It is built into the Facebook social media platform, thus allowing buyers and sellers to view each others profiles. This aids in verification and filtering out scam profiles. It also allows buyers and sellers alike to leave reviews about each other, displaying the good and bad reviews alike. Although it does have built in safety features, there are concerns about scam sellers and buyers, as well as personal safety and discretion issues when meeting in person.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
This plafrom displays an effective combination of combining the listing ability of an E-commerce platform with the convenience of a widely used messaging platform. However, it does not have any barrier to entry, allowing anyone to make any number of accounts they wish and listing whatever they want whenever they want. This lack of exclusivity leaves the door open to phishing and scams. Many of these issues could be resolved by using Hanover emails as a method of entry to a platform.

## 2. Craigslist

**Link:** [https://www.craigslist.org](https://www.craigslist.org)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site and is an online platform to buy, sell, and trade.  

**Relation to App:**  
This source is another prominent and competing platform, though it is somewhat dated.  

**Summary:**  
Craigslist acts as an online ad driven website that has a wide range of categories including buying, selling, housing, jobs, services, and more. It is an early example of a local buying and selling platform which relies heavily on text heavy pages.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
This platform excels through its diverse categorization and simplicity. Nevertheless, it is an outdated platform that has change very little since its launch and has few safety features to protect users. My Hanover Marketplace could solve the safety and security features of this flatform while also learning from its categorical abilities.

## 3. OfferUp

**Link:** [https://offerup.com](https://offerup.com)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site that puts an emphasis on mobility  

**Relation to App:**  
This is a competitive and similar program that shows off a more modern and mobile-user friendly design.  

**Summary:**  
OfferUp is a mobile app for buyers and sellers to find goods locally. It is similar to the other sources that I have listed but is designed around convenience for mobile users. Rather than the plain text heavy listings found on Craigslist, OfferUp listings are centered around pictures of the items.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
OfferUp is an example of a strong app based platform designed for mobile use and displays the importance of making a visually appealing and easy to use platform. However, OfferUp also struggles with trust, anonimity, and other security issues. I believe that integrating a picture based listing would be benificial, thought security improvements could be made through the use of Hanover emails and or other identity verification methods.

## 4. VarageSale

**Link:** [https://www.varagesale.com](https://www.varagesale.com)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site that is a resale platform focused on community.  

**Relation to App:**  
This has a comperable premise to my intended project, with an emphasis on community which parallels the intent of my Hanover community based platform.  

**Summary:**  
VarageSale is an app-based platform which is used to buy and sell things locally. It has a focus on safety, requiring verification of members through local administration before being able to post. It also has numerous categories, as well as a reputation system for buyers and sellers.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
VarageSale’s has implemented similar tools and ideas to the intended design of the Hanover Marketplace idea. It has an added benefit of administration filtered security as well as categories for items. However, rather than relying on administration verification, a more simple automated user security could be implemented through the use of hanover emails.

## 5. University-Specific Marketplaces (Example: Yale Free & For Sale Facebook Group)

**Link:** [https://www.facebook.com/groups/150454865086](https://www.facebook.com/groups/150454865086)

**Source Type:**  
This source is secondary, and is a community group hosted on the Facebook platform. Given this, it is not an official product.  

**Relation to App:**  
Although this source is comparable, it is a more relaxed and informal setting that is a campus only platform rather than a larger more available platform.  

**Summary:**  
Many colleges and universities have student created groups where students trade textbooks, dorm furniture, and other items. These groups are usually on social media platforms like Facebook and rely on student moderators for verification of new members.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
These secondary appearances of campus “buy and sell” groups show that there is a real-world demand for campus specific marketplaces. However, they currently rely on students for administration of the group and an overarching social media platform for their existence. Through the creation of a Hanover specific app, this process could be streamlined by automation for verification and could remove the need for a third-party platform.  





# Technologies

## 1. Web App Development

**Link:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

**Source Type:**  
This is a secondary source with tutorials provided by Mozilla, a reputable name in web tech.  

**Relation to App:**  
A Hanover exclusive marketplace would be most accessible as a web app that could be accessed from computers or mobile devices alike on any browser. This would provide broad compatibility without needing to build multiple apps.  

**Summary:**  
Web applications are delivered through browsers and built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They can be scaled easily, can be hosted on cloud platforms, and can be easily integrated with APIs and databases. Unlike desktop or CLI tools, a web app provides a graphical interface that is immediately accessible to users.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
A web application reduces the number of new things to tackle compared to building a dedicated mobile ios or android app. Since students already access college services through browsers, a web application is a straightforward and effective step that can be easily accessed by the students and faculty.

## 2. Programming Languages for Web Development (JavaScript, Python, Java)

**Link:** [Python, JavaScript, or Java – which is best for your needs?](https://www.qa.com/resources/blog/python-vs-javascript-vs-java/)

**Source Type:**  
This is a secondary source that provides a comparison of programming languages and their use cases.  

**Relation to App:**  
This is tool that can aid in the selection of the time and place for each language in the project, or which language would be best overall. This allows me to balance my existing experience with needed learning efficiently.  

**Summary:**  
- **JavaScript**: Runs natively in the browser and is required for front-end interactivity. When combined with Node.js, it can also power the backend, making it a full-stack option.  
- **Python**: Known for readability and strong frameworks for backend development. However, it is less suited for client side browser execution.  
- **Java**: Strong backend option that can also be used to build Android apps; however, it is heavier for web development when compared to Python or Node.js.

## 3. Frameworks vs Libraries

**Link:** [What's the Difference Between a Framework and Library? (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/frameworks-vs-libraries/)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a secondary educational source that refreshes knowledge on this topic.  

**Relation to App:**  
Understanding the technical distinction between frameworks and libraries is important knowledge when choosing the right tools for the job. This source shows the distinction between the two, showing that frameworks provide structure and control, while libraries offer focused functionality without enforcing architecture.  

**Summary:**  
- A **library** is a piece of reusable code that your application calls when needed, offering autonomy and modularity.  
- A **framework** dictates the structure and flow of your application. It essentially tells you what to do and when, embodying an architectural scaffolding.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
Understanding the distinction between libraries and frameworks enables more informed decisions when selecting technologies. For Hanover Marketplace, I might use a framework like React to structure your frontend, paired with libraries like Axios for HTTP requests or Bootstrap for styling.

## 4. Databases (PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB)

**Link:** [https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-postgresql](https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-postgresql)

**Source Type:**  
This is a secondary source that compares vendors.  

**Relation to App:**  
To have a functioning marketplace, you must have persistent storage that includes users, items, reviews, and transactions.  

**Summary:**  
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database with strong consistency that is widely used with Django and Spring Boot.  
- **Firebase (Google)**: A cloud-hosted, NoSQL with built-in authentication. This is easy to integrate with web/mobile.  
- **MongoDB**: A flexible NoSQL document store that is well suited for changing blueprints.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
If students' data and reviews are to be implemented, PostgreSQL would need to be robust. If rapid setup and future scalability are the driving factors, Firebase offers an all in one backend. MongoDB is a middle ground for flexibility.

## 5. Hosting & Deployment (Heroku, AWS, Vercel)

**Link:** [https://www.heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary source that hosts provider documentation.  

**Relation to App:**  
The app needs to be hosted and deployed somewhere accessible to Hanover students.  

**Summary:**  
- **Heroku**: This is a beginner-friendly PaaS that supports Node.js, Python, and Java. It is a simple Git-based deployment.  
- **AWS**: This is enterprise-grade and highly scalable, but more complex. It supports EC2, RDS, and S3 storage.  
- **Vercel/Netlify**: This is tailored for frameworks like React and provides instant deployment and free tiers.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
Given the scope of a campus-specific app, Heroku and Vercel would provide the fastest path with minimal setup overhead. AWS could be explored if scalability or advanced features are needed later.
