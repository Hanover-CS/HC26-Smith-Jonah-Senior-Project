# Annotated Bibliography

## 1. Facebook Marketplace

**Link:** [https://www.facebook.com/marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site that is officially licensed and run by Facebook/Meta  

**Relation to App:**  
This app is similar to my end goal and is a leader in the private-used-E commerce platforms  

**Summary:**  
Facebook Marketplace is a platform that allows private buyers and sellers to engage in a local used marketplace. It is built into the Facebook social media platform, thus allowing buyers and sellers to view each others profiles. This aids in verification and filtering out scam profiles. It also allows buyers and sellers alike to leave reviews about each other, displaying the good and bad reviews alike. Although it does have built in safety features, there are concerns about scam sellers and buyers, as well as personal safety and discretion issues when meeting in person.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
This plafrom displays an effective combination of combining the listing ability of an E-commerce platform with the convenience of a widely used messaging platform. However, it does not have any barrier to entry, allowing anyone to make any number of accounts they wish and listing whatever they want whenever they want. This lack of exclusivity leaves the door open to phishing and scams. Many of these issues could be resolved by using Hanover emails as a method of entry to a platform.  



## 2. Craigslist

**Link:** [https://www.craigslist.org](https://www.craigslist.org)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site and is an online platform to buy, sell, and trade.  

**Relation to App:**  
This source is another prominent and competing platform, though it is somewhat dated.  

**Summary:**  
Craigslist acts as an online ad driven website that has a wide range of categories including buying, selling, housing, jobs, services, and more. It is an early example of a local buying and selling platform which relies heavily on text heavy pages.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
This platform excels through its diverse categorization and simplicity. Nevertheless, it is an outdated platform that has change very little since its launch and has few safety features to protect users. My Hanover Marketplace could solve the safety and security features of this flatform while also learning from its categorical abilities.  



## 3. OfferUp

**Link:** [https://offerup.com](https://offerup.com)

**Source Type:**  
This source is a primary site that puts an emphasis on mobility  

**Relation to App:**  
This is a competitive and similar program that shows off a more modern and mobile-user friendly design.  

**Summary:**  
OfferUp is a mobile app for buyers and sellers to find goods locally. It is similar to the other sources that I have listed but is designed around convenience for mobile users. Rather than the plain text heavy listings found on Craigslist, OfferUp listings are centered around pictures of the items.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
OfferUp is an example of a strong app based platform designed for mobile use and displays the importance of making a visually appealing and easy to use platform. However, OfferUp also struggles with trust, anonimity, and other security issues. I believe that integrating a picture based listing would be benificial, thought security improvements could be made through the use of Hanover emails and or other identity verification methods.
