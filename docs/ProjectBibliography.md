**Summary:**  
Facebook Marketplace is a platform that allows private buyers and sellers to engage in a local used marketplace. It is built into the Facebook social media platform, thus allowing buyers and sellers to view each others profiles. This aids in verification and filtering out scam profiles. It also allows buyers and sellers alike to leave reviews about each other, displaying the good and bad reviews alike. Although it does have built in safety features, there are concerns about scam sellers and buyers, as well as personal safety and discretion issues when meeting in person.  

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
This plafrom displays an effective combination of combining the listing ability of an E-commerce platform with the convenience of a widely used messaging platform. However, it does not have any barrier to entry, allowing anyone to make any number of accounts they wish and listing whatever they want whenever they want. This lack of exclusivity leaves the door open to phishing and scams. Many of these issues could be resolved by using Hanover emails as a method of entry to a platform.
