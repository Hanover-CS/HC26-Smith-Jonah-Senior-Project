# Annotated Bibliography

## 1. Facebook Marketplace

**Link:** [https://www.facebook.com/marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace)

**Source Type:**  
Primary site officially run by Facebook/Meta.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
This marketplace is similar to my end goal; it is one of the leaders among peer-to-peer e-commerce platforms.

**Summary:**  
Facebook Marketplace lets private buyers and sellers engage in a local used marketplace. Because it’s tied to Facebook profiles, users can see each other’s profiles, which adds a layer of accountability. Listings include images and text; reviews between users exist. While it has safety features, there are also concerns about scam listings and personal safety during meetups.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
This platform shows how combining social identity with commerce can help with trust and verification. However, it lacks exclusivity, allowing almost anyone to join. My Hanover Marketplace would address this by restricting access to those with verified Hanover email accounts, reducing opportunities for misuse.

## 2. Craigslist

**Link:** [https://www.craigslist.org](https://www.craigslist.org)

**Source Type:**  
Primary source: large, long-established platform for classifieds.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
Craigslist is one of the older “local buy/sell/trade” platforms, serving as a contrast because of its simplicity and minimal safety features.

**Summary:**  
Craigslist supports a wide variety of item categories, job listings, housing, etc. It is largely text-based and has changed little in terms of interface. There is little built-in moderation, and safety features are minimal.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
It does well in providing broad categorization, but weaknesses include lack of safety and dated design. My project can incorporate Craigslist’s strengths in categorization, while improving on user safety and modern interface design.

## 3. OfferUp

**Link:** [https://offerup.com](https://offerup.com)

**Source Type:**  
Primary, mobile-friendly used goods marketplace.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
OfferUp demonstrates modern UX for mobile, picture-centric listings, and local transactions.

**Summary:**  
Offers image-heavy listings and focus on mobile users. Reviews help somewhat with trust, but concern remains over anonymity, fraud, or misrepresentation of items.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
Helps illustrate the importance of clean visuals and mobile usability; informs how the Hanover Marketplace should structure listings. Security enhancements (email verification etc.) can be inspired by OfferUp’s review/feedback systems.

## 4. VarageSale

**Link:** [https://www.varagesale.com](https://www.varagesale.com)

**Source Type:**  
Primary resale platform focused on local community.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
VarageSale is similar in intent due to its focus on community, trust, and local transactions, thus making it a good model for comparison.

**Summary:**  
Requires admin/member verification, includes categorization and user reviews. More community-oriented. Slightly more oversight required than more freeform marketplaces.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
Good example of balancing safety and usability. My proposal leans toward automated verification (Hanover email) instead of heavy manual administrative gates, which streamlines the process while preserving trust.

## 5. Yale Alumni Marketplace (Facebook Group)

**Link:** [https://www.facebook.com/groups/yalealumnimarketplace/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/yalealumnimarketplace/) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Source Type:**  
Secondary / community-group hosted on Facebook, limited to Yale alumni, recent grads, and graduating students.  

**Relation to Proposal:**  
Provides an example of university-exclusive marketplace usage: people trading items only among the university’s community.

**Summary:**  
The group is closed, membership restricted to Yale community members. Users post items ranging from furniture, books, etc. It relies on member oversight and self policing rather than a formal application or automated system.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
Shows there *is* demand for exclusive campus communities. It also reveals trade-offs: moderation overhead, less structured UI (since it’s a Facebook group), and reliance on third-party platform constraints. These show what to improve upon—structured categories, better moderation tools, possibly a more purpose-built platform.

## 6. React Official Docs

**Link:** [https://react.dev](https://react.dev)

**Source Type:**  
Primary documentation source for React, a major front-end library/framework.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
Used as an alternative in “Alternative Technologies” when comparing front-end framework choices.

**Summary:**  
React enables dynamic, component-based user interfaces and is widely used in modern web apps. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires more overhead than simple server-rendered templates.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
React was considered for the Hanover Marketplace, but I instead selected Thymeleaf to reduce complexity and integrate directly with Spring Boot. Nonetheless, React docs inform what trade-offs exist (client-side rendering, bundling, etc.).

## 7. MySQL Official Site

**Link:** [https://www.mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com]

**Source Type:**  
Primary vendor site/documentation.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
Used as comparison for database alternatives in “Alternative Technologies.”

**Summary:**  
MySQL is a relational database with broad adoption. It supports typical SQL features and is well known, but sometimes lags behind PostgreSQL in advanced queries, concurrency control, or some performance features.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
MySQL was considered, but I decided to use **PostgreSQL** instead because of its stronger capabilities and better free‐hosting support in some contexts.

## 8. Amazon AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

**Link:** [https://aws.amazon.com/s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)

**Source Type:**  
Primary vendor documentation.

**Relation to Proposal:**  
Used in “Alternative Technologies” to compare image hosting solutions.

**Summary:**  
AWS S3 is industry-standard object storage that is scalable and reliable, with many integration options. However, it usually requires more configuration and cost management than purpose-made services like Cloudinary.

**Relevance & Commentary:**  
S3 was considered, however, I selected **Cloudinary** for this project due to its free tier and simpler integration for storing/resizing/serving images.
