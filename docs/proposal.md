# Hanover Community Marketplace Platform

## Project Overview
The project that I propose is te development of a Hanover student, staff, and faculty exclusive online marketplace. It would allow users to buy, sell, and trade items such as furniture, electronics, and textbooks on a trusted campus platform.

**Main Features:**
- **User Authentication:** Access to the platform would be restricted to verified hanover email addresses.
- **Listings:** The listings would be picture based and categorized for easier searching and listings.
- **Profiles and Reviews:** Each profile will be unique and have reviews and history attatched to their account.
- **Search and Filters/Categories:** There will be tools availiable to search and list items by category, price, etc.
- **Security and Safety:** Automated verification through verified Hanover emails restrics access, and meet up safety can be built in.
- **Device Accessibility:** This is intended to be avaliable and used on computers and mobile devices alike via web applications.

The aim for the platform would be to bring the convenience of exiting online markeplaces with the exclusivity of a campus restricted community.

## Comparing with Exesting Solutions

There are multiple existing platforms that have a variety of approaches to online marketplaces. Although they have their individual flaws, they have traits that can influence and improve the creation of a Hanover Campus exlusive marketplace.

- **Facebook Marketplace** [1]: This platform is tied to the social media profiles of the platform and excells is categorization and filtering. However, it has issues with scamming and shadey behavior.
- **Craigslist** [2]: This is a platform that has been around for a long time with little change. This leaves it with a dated design and interface as well as lacking security measures; however, it has a wide range of listing ability and browsing filters.
- **OfferUp** [3]: This is a modern platform that is focused on mobile device users. Nevertheless, it also suffers from trust issues between buyers and sellers.
- **VarageSale** [4]: This is a platform that focuses on community. It impliments admin verification for joining members. Although this is an imporvement for security, it is held back by its reliance on manual oversight rather than automated verification.
- **University Buy and Sell Groups** [5]: This platform, and others like it, are secondary sources that are run on social media platforms like Facebook. This allows for the convenience of a small local marketplace, but suffers a similar administration issue as Varagesale and is reliant on third party platforms.

When compared to these examples, the Hanover Marketplace would be able to provide a standalone and campus exclusive solution. It could also have a straighforward and streamlined design that focuses on ease of use.
