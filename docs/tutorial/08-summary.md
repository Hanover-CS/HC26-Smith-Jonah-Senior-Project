# 8) Summary

Congratulations!
You’ve completed the full tutorial and successfully integrated **Cloudinary** with a **Spring Boot** web application.  
Throughout this process, you learned how to securely manage credentials, configure dependencies, upload images, and display them in a dynamic web interface.

---

## 8.1 What You Built

By the end of this tutorial, your project includes:

- ✅ **A Spring Boot backend** configured for Cloudinary integration  
- ✅ **A Cloudinary configuration bean** that securely reads environment variables  
- ✅ **A service layer (`ImageService`)** for handling uploads  
- ✅ **Thymeleaf-based front-end pages** for uploading and displaying images  
- ✅ **A working connection to the Cloudinary dashboard**

Your app can now take an uploaded image, send it to Cloudinary, and display the hosted image link in seconds — all using clean, production-ready Java code.

## 8.2 Target Audience Review

This tutorial was designed for **intermediate Java developers** or **students** familiar with:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic Spring Boot concepts
- HTML templates and simple front-end work

---

## 8.3 Good Practices to Maintain

- **Keep secrets secret** — never commit `.env` or credential files to GitHub.  
- **Validate inputs** — always check file types and sizes before upload.   
- **Version control wisely** — commit only code and templates, not temporary build files.  
- **Use descriptive commit messages** — e.g., “GREEN: Cloudinary upload verified.”

## 8.4 Final Thoughts

By following this tutorial you’ve demonstrated your ability to:
- Integrate an external cloud service into a full-stack Java project  
- Manage environment variables for secure configuration  
- Build, test, and troubleshoot a production-style Spring Boot app
